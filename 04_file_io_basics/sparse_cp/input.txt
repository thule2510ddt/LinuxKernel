 The tee command reads its standard input until end-of-file, writing a
 
 
 
  copy of the input
 to standard output and to the file named in its command-line argument. (We show
 an example of the use of this command 
 
                when we discuss FIFOs                                           in Section 44.7.)




 Implement tee using I/O system calls. By default, tee overwrites any existing file with
 the given name. Implement the –a command-line option 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 program should perform an lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END) call before each write(). Run                                           two instances of this program at the same time without the x argument to write
 1 million bytes to the same file:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (tee –a file), which causes tee
 to append text to the end of a file if it already exists. (Refer to Appendix B 
                     for a
 description of the                                    getopt() function, which can be used to parse command-line
 options.)
